# Eternal Loop 
## By: Saber Tiger
I get up again with my wounded body
Tomorrow's the only way to go
Palms are for loving, that's what I was told
I squeezed and hid my fists for love to live, for love to live

The true meaning of why I'm not leaving alone
I realize in a chain of breaths that has been handed down
I hoped to live in a pure future
Emanation that I am battling earnestly

Repeated destruction and sins
If that's the fate of the human race
I will grab tomorrow with only my hands
And cut the ring!

Even if I can't deal with my long, long life
I don't want to mistake the place to live
For the place to death. No matter what

Repeated destruction and sins
If that's the fate of the human race
I will grab tomorrow with only my hands
And cut the ring!

Even if I can't deal with my long, long life
I don't want to mistake the place to live
For the place to death. No matter what

With the strength of stepping out
From the closed eternal loop
I will spread my weak wings
Until my heart's content

I can't help myself dreaming the same dream
No matter how much pain
How much pain I've got! I've got! I've got!!
No matter how much, no matter how much
I've lost in deep darkness!
I have my future in hand
Go forward from now on

In a spiral woodland
Tomorrow never comes by screaming
Despair won't get me heard anything
There weren't any stars to the sky, anywhere
People sowed hopes in the hearts
The time, you have spent wasn't wasted
There will be someone waiting for you
Until then, I hope you live precious life

In spite of looking back hangs heavy upon me
I won't blame myself anymore
While I've been feeling people's pain
I've been hurt enough already

Let me catch dropping tears on my palm
And I will keep watching forever
When the tears dry out by gentle light
I should see my hope
