title: Active Galactic Nucleus
---
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a region at the center of a galaxy that emits a significant amount of radiation and displays strong variability in its emission properties. This phenomenon is thought to be caused by the accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole located at the center of the galaxy.

As material falls into the black hole, it heats up and emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays. This process generates a significant amount of energy, making AGNs some of the most luminous objects in the universe.

AGNs can exhibit a variety of emission features, including broad emission lines, X-ray emission, and strong radio emission. The properties of the emission lines can be used to classify AGNs into different types, such as Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars.

The study of AGNs is an active area of research, with astronomers using a variety of techniques to understand the physical processes that drive their emission. This includes studying the variability of AGNs on various timescales, measuring the properties of the accretion disks and jets that surround the black hole, and investigating the interaction between the black hole and the surrounding gas and stars in the galaxy.

AGNs are also important probes of the evolution of galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes. Understanding the properties and behavior of AGNs is therefore crucial to our understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe as a whole.

## Technique used to study AGN

Astronomers use a variety of techniques to study active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here are some of the techniques:

1. Spectroscopy: Astronomers use spectroscopy to study the emission lines in AGNs. Spectroscopy involves breaking down the light emitted by an AGN into its component wavelengths, revealing information about the elements and physical conditions in the emitting gas. This technique can be used to study the velocity of gas in the accretion disk and measure the mass of the central black hole.

2. X-ray and Gamma-ray Astronomy: AGNs emit copious amounts of X-rays and gamma rays, which can be detected by telescopes that are sensitive to these high-energy wavelengths. These observations can provide information about the geometry and physical processes that occur in the accretion disk and jets around the black hole.

3. Radio Astronomy: AGNs also emit strong radio waves, which can be detected by radio telescopes. These observations can reveal the structure and properties of the jets that are launched from the AGN, as well as the magnetic fields and other physical conditions in the surrounding gas.

4. Time-domain Astronomy: Astronomers study the variability of AGNs on various timescales, from hours to years. This can provide information about the physical processes that occur near the black hole, such as changes in the accretion rate or the launching of a new jet.

5. Multi-wavelength Astronomy: AGNs emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Studying AGNs at multiple wavelengths can provide a more complete picture of their properties and behavior.
